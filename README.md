# snake_blanket

I like making colorful geometric patterns as an arts and crafts project.

This is a field of tetrahedrods (equilateral triangles divided into shaded sections).

There are two color patterns: a diagonal background color gradient and the "snakes"

Each snake is made of two contrasting color patterns that shift hue along the length of the snake

Each successive snake shift hue as you move up and down the page

:thinking:
